# Write a program that randomly generates a lottery of a
# two-digit number, prompts the user to enter a two
# single-digit number, and determines whether the user
# wins according to the following rule:
#  If the user input matches the lottery in exact order,
# the award is $10,000.
#  If the user input matches the lottery but not in the
# same order the award is $3,000.
#  If only a single number in the user input matches a
# digit in the lottery, the award is $1,000.
#  If there is no match, the award is $0.
